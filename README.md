# VehiclePhysics
Vehicle Physics project written with Unreal Engine Blueprints

My primary goal is making this project as portable as it can be.

Creating vehicles with DataTables. Automatically created vehicle setups maybe with just a name or VehicleID which is unique in a DataTable. 

Modify / tuning parts even will be considered in this project.

Be sure to check Projects section to see progress.

This will project will be ported to C++ after completing in Blueprints for performance improvement.

This project is based on the tutorials from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2iKJPXiC7vFyBsynfd_XNg/videos">Ivan Novozhilov's YouTube Channel</a> with many changes from me for fair use.
